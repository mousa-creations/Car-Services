## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://getbootstrap.com) - For styles

### Continued development

This website was built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I'm working with Bootstrap. The navbar and hero section came first, then the features and newsletter, and lastly the footer. I'd want to learn more about a company's vehicle services and how to schedule them.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp?) - This helped me for convert hsl color to hex color. I really liked this tool and will use it going forward.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) - This is an amazing docs which helped me finally understand bootstrap. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept with Bootstrap, the worldâ€™s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites.
